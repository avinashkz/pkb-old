  book is a collection of essays on the great social reformer of Kerala and spiritual 
  leader Sri. Narayana Guru published on the event of his birth centenary. It 
  gives a rare insight into the person and activities of a visionary. The essays 
  are classified into eight parts as follows:</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">1. Dark Background 
  and Some Resplendent Documents: </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
  This section contains 38 documents consisting of articles by prominent personalities, 
  proclamations, extracts from other documents etc. Greatness cannot be de-linked 
  from space and time. Seen in this context, a life history not linked to a historical 
  background will be incomplete. Swami's activities and the ascendancy of Ezhavas 
  ( A hindu community of kerala) are interlinked. The effort in this section is 
  to give a brief of the historical background necessary for this study. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">2. A Life Changed 
  Without Knowing Challenge: </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
  It is not the intention of the book to chronologically describe the life of 
  the saint. Depending on the interest and ability of the reader a concept of 
  the saint will get imprinted in their minds from the book. This section also 
  contains the brief anecdotes/ sayings of the Sri Narayana Guru.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">3. The Mirror of 
  Memories:</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
  This section contains seven commemorative articles by people who were closely 
  associated with Narayana Guru. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">4. Biographical 
  Setting:</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
  These are articles by P.K. Balakrishnan on the life of seven of Gurudev's disciples 
  who were versatile in nature and beliefs and yet worked together without compromising 
  their beliefs. And that ability to work together getting beyond their inherent 
  contradictions is Narayana Guru.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">5. The Poetry of 
  Vision and the Poet's Vision:</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
  This section intents to give a picture of Narayana Guru as a poet. <br>
  Though he was never reputed as a poet, he wrote some of the best hymns in the 
  language. The preface to the hymns and instructions regarding the selections 
  were given by Dr. Sukumar Azhicode</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">6. Contemporary 
  Narayana Guru:</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
  We are products of contemporary times. The events we see are also coloured by 
  this subconscious 'political' beliefs. This section contains such contemporary 
  studies of the Guru. This direct transition in time may help to understand history 
  better. This section contains six studies.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">7. A Reformer in 
  the Arena of Religion:</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
  This section contains nine articles on what the authors perceived as the religious 
  beliefs of Narayana Guru. Whether the Guru was an inventor of a new religious 
  philosophy or a religious reformer is an open question.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">8. Narayana Guru 
  and Social Transition:</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
  The Narayana Guru we know today primarily is a social reformer. Any study that 
  does not touch the social aspect will be unrealistic. This section contains 
  six articles that predominantly deal with the social angle.</font></p>
