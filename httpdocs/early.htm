        <span class="style1">Edavanakkaad  - that is the name of the beautiful village in Vypeen island off the coast of  Ernakulam where Balakrishnan was born to Kesavan Asan and Mani in a lower  middle class family. The youngest after three daughters, he had the pride of place  in the family. His sisters were Janaki, Lakshmi and Parvathi. Nearest to him in  age, he recalls Parvathy as his naughty sister constantly reporting on him and  earning him frequent taste of the rod. He used to recall ruefully that after  appreciating as &lsquo;the great goat&rsquo;, the dog he had made, she was instrumental in  him being caught red handed while trying to taste the baked clay figure. With  years his area of activity extended to the neighbourhood and then beyond with  his cousins Sekharan, Chennan and Kesavan. <br>
        <br>
        Still far away from development, travelling were through country paths and the  luxury carrier, the cycle came only later. His sister Parvathy remembers that  people used to run after the elephant to see it wade through water to cross as  there were only log bridges. For longer journeys one had to depend on the boat.  The child hood flavours of this beautiful village can be caught in his novel  &lsquo;Pluto&rsquo;. <br>
        <br>
        He was very good with his studies which was not neglected even after his father  was bedridden with paralysis. He passed school with a gold medal and went on to  study in college which was the prerogative of the rich at that time.</span></p>
