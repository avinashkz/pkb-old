  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The theories of linguistic evolution  that rests on the concept that Malayalis were part of a larger Tamil area  speaking an early Dravidian dialect like the Tamilians would naturally lead to  erroneous conclusions.&nbsp; The completely  absurd idea that the Tamil Brahmin and the Namboodiri of this hilly terrain are  the same Brahmin stock that represents the colonisation of the Sanskrit forms a  fundamental thought of the existing linguistic evolution theories.&nbsp; The 8th century Tamil is a  language that is adequately developed with proper grammatical structure and was  a counted literary language.&nbsp; Extending this  Tamil language and the causative social background to Kerala also is another of  the basic concepts of our language theories.&nbsp;  Having proceeded on these undoubtably erroneous presumptions, it is not  surprising that they reached the arguments as to whether Malayalam is the  daughter or sister of Tamil.&nbsp; And it is  not surprising that those having more intense love for the language discovered  that Malayalam is the mother of Tamil.&nbsp;  We need not be surprised that they could not think of enquiring into the  origins of the language of a people that existed in an inaccessible hilly  terrain in the dialects of the hill tribes that existed then and still  exists.&nbsp; In the case of early historians,  they could not see or remedy the limitations of the historical concepts of  1850s.</font></em></font></p>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first scientific study on Malayalam  language is by F.W. Ellis.&nbsp; &lsquo;A  Dissertation on the Malayalam Language&rsquo; later earned him a permanent place in  the history of Malayalam literature.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  He was the genius who first stated the concept of Comparative Grammar in  his dissertation.&nbsp; This amazing genius  who died of poisoning at the age of 40 in 1819 wrote his Dissertation in 1816.&nbsp; It was after 1850 &ndash;after publishing of Carldwell&rsquo;s  Study of Comparative Grammar of Dravidian Languages and Dr Gundert&rsquo;s Malayalam  Grammar &ndash; that this study of Ellis was discovered.&nbsp; It was a misfortune that produced far  reaching effects.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Had Carldwell or  Gundert seen it, we have to think that it would have substantially altered  their thoughts on evolution of the language. </font></em></font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font color="#000000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><em><font color="#CCCCCC"><br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This study of Malayalam by Ellis is also  written accepting the erroneous historical milieu and social development backdrop  mentioned earlier.&nbsp; When Kerala history  was not yet written it was not possible for someone in 1816 to assume that the  Tamil kings of the Chera dynasty had not ruled Kerala&nbsp; or poems like &lsquo;Chilapathikaram&rsquo; were not composed  in the Chera court at Kodungalloor.&nbsp;  Similarly it was not possible for one to assume that the reign of the  Perumals were just myth.&nbsp; And no one  could say that the concept of a wider Tamil area speaking the early Dravidian  language was absurd.&nbsp; In spite of all these,  the contradiction between the peculiarities of the evolution of the language  being described and the historical and natural background caught the attention  of that genius.&nbsp; Consequently the study  of that genius moved to some exceptional assumptions.&nbsp; He saw that the areas south of Kollam and the  traditional areas of &lsquo;the land of hills&rsquo; to the north showed difference in the  matter of language.&nbsp; He clearly stated  that though the use of chaste Chentamil was widespread he did not think that  the people of north knew Tamil.&nbsp; When he  says that this situation is most strange considering the duration of the period  Kerala was under the Chera Kings and considering that many of the eminent Tamil  literary works were written here, it shows an incompatibility between the facts  of the language and the historical conditions. </font></em></font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font color="#000000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><em><font color="#CCCCCC"><br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Spreading his thoughts to the side that  Malayalam language was never subjected to treatment as an independent language  nor a single book written on the language or grammar (1816) and wondering how  this happened in a language that was just a step away from a well developed  language (Tamil), Ellis did get to see the difference between the Tamil and  Malayali people.&nbsp; And he found the reason  in the fundamental difference between the position of the Tamil Brahmin and that  of the Namboodiris in Kerala.&nbsp; Ellis  writes that if there were science and literature in Malayalam, it is generally  true that they are in Sanskrit.&nbsp; But even  in these fields, no works in Sanskrit &ndash; barring the books of Sankaracharya  which cannot be said to be of Kerala &ndash; are linked to the area which can be  counted as Kerala. In Tamil Nadu there was competition between Brahmins and the  lower castes for&nbsp;&nbsp; supremacy in  knowledge.&nbsp; From north they brought the  language of science (Sanskrit) there.&nbsp;  When they took their place in southern India,  the Brahmins found that there was a local literature in existence.&nbsp; In their long struggle with the entrenched  Jains, for their own safety, they were compelled to promote the local  language&hellip;All the saintly Alwars are Sudras (lower castes).&nbsp; But the Brahmins had to become their  followers and worship them as saints.&nbsp;  When the absolute authorities in many Shiva temples were of the Sudra  caste, Brahmins were the regular priests.&nbsp;  These kind of things never happened in Kerala.&nbsp; The worship of Shiva and other deities  continues undisturbed here as when the Namboodiris established it.&nbsp; The situation did not change even after they  were naturalised by laying claim on the women in the area except those of the  lower castes and creating a kindred race among the locals.&nbsp; These Brahmins were able to stand separate  and above this kindred race born of their own blood.&nbsp; </font></em></font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font color="#000000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><em><font color="#CCCCCC"><br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this circumstance it cannot be  expected that Namboodiris will nourish the Malayalam language.&nbsp; Religious and logical rivalries have at all  times and all countries been a model that has encouraged attempts of lofty literary  creations.&nbsp; Since this competitive  encouragement was absent (in Malayalam), the reason for the neglect of Sudras  (by Namboodiris) were self evident.&nbsp; In  these circumstances it is natural that there was no independent literature in a  sub language that was one step away from a much developed language (Tamil).</font></em></font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font color="#000000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><em><font color="#CCCCCC"><br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is because of the fact that Ellis&rsquo;  study stops at the cardinal point of difference between the Malayalam and Tamil  people, that I said that Cardwell and Gundert would have altered their thoughts  on the evolution of Malayalam language if they had chanced to see it.&nbsp; It is not my aim to examine the existing  theories of evolution of the language in the light of scientific language  theories.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But any one can see that the  special facts that link the natural milieu and human elements have to be  considered for language study.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a  simple truth that it has not happened in the study of evolution of the  Malayalam language.&nbsp; </font></em></font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font color="#000000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><em><font color="#CCCCCC"><br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The language of the tribes surviving on  primitive methods will be limited to a primitive dialect necessary for the  communication needs of such a survival.&nbsp;  The vocabulary of such a dialect will not touch the institution or  methods of an advanced social life.&nbsp; In a  situation where the contact between different tribes and clans were limited to  attacking rivalry, it is extremely rare for the dialects to merge or be  modified for mutual communication.&nbsp; It is  seen that when western contacts started in America  in 16th century, among the Red Indian tribes of the mainland there  were 2000 dialects which were mutually exclusive and none of them had the  written form.&nbsp; In Assam  where there are divergent people including partially civilised hill tribes, the  number of languages and dialects which are not mutually understandable touches 175.&nbsp; In Kerala where hill tribes still speak divergent  dialects, it can certainly be assumed that there were several intertribal  dialects in 7th,8th centuries.&nbsp; In such a Kerala , merging it with the Tamil  areas by doing away with the Western Ghats and in that nonexistent communion searching for the origins of  Malayalam language in the &lsquo;Aadidramila language is a pathetic repetition of the  beaten track.&nbsp; </font></em></font></p>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For students of the science of language,  the details of Paniya language is available today.&nbsp; &nbsp;It may  not be contrary to established fundamentals of language to assume that with its  grammar and other tools it is an independent dialect though full of Malayalam  words through limited contacts throughout the ages with the malayali people.&nbsp; Anyway Anthropology will not permit to say  that the dialect with its grammatical equipments is a subordinate language  derived from Malayalam.&nbsp; A similar  dialect of the hilly terrain, due the influence of Sanskrit and Prakriti  languages with its own grammatical equipments developed into the Malayalam  language.&nbsp; It has to be assumed that the  language replaced the various tribal dialects of the agrarian villages in the hilly  land.&nbsp; It is a widely known fact of World  history that Greek language developed out of the Attic dialect, one among the  tribal dialects expelling others.&nbsp;</font></em></font></p>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Namboodiris developed a strange  interaction with the castes that they converged out of the hilly tribes in the  agrarian village.&nbsp; In spite of depending  on erroneous historical and cultural backgrounds, moving to thoughts on  language development through an analysis of the internal structure of the  language, Ellis could think that special reasons were required for the skewed  development of the language. &nbsp;Thus  thinking he could find the reason in the strange position and mentality of the  Namboodiri.&nbsp; This is a fact that salutes  the miraculous gift of his genius.&nbsp; We  have already seen one side of the evolution that occurred to the local dialect  brought about by the contact of the Namboodiris with the Keralite community and  contact with the Sanskrit-Prakriti languages (both these contacts were  unconditional dominances).&nbsp; We need to  see a few more facets that completes and further clarifies this insight.</font></em></font></p>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Logan observes that  the only serious difference that Malayalam has from other Dravidian languages  is that it is comparatively filled with words adapted or derived from  Sanskrit.&nbsp; Dr Godavarma starts his study  on borrowed terms in Malayalam with the observation that Malayalam is the most  sanskritised of the Dravidian languages and in addition to the words derived  and adapted from Sanskrit, it contains many words from Prakriti.&nbsp; Prof P.Sankaran Nambiar points out that in  north Indian languages like Hindi, Bangali, Marathi etc it is seen that fifty  percent of the words are Sanskrit, and in the case of Malayalam it is  greater.&nbsp; It also won&rsquo;t be wrong to say  that for a consummate scholar of the language, his Malayalam dictionary is &lsquo;Amaram  Paaremeshwari&rsquo; and any word in that Sanskrit dictionary can be accepted as a  Malayalam word.&nbsp; The state of the  language shows the role and position of the Namboodiris in the interaction that  came into existence between them and the local populace.</font></em></font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font color="#000000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><em><font color="#CCCCCC"><br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However much a language transforms, it  is impossible to change names or natural relations.&nbsp; This statement of Prof Nambiar contains a  well established common law of the science of language.&nbsp; What was ordinarily impossible was easily  achieved in Malayalam as can be seen by the observations of Dr.Godavarma noted  below or through own observation:<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;That even the illiterate Malayalis use  Sanskrit words in their speech for the ordinary ideas in daily life like &lsquo;pleasure&rsquo;,  sorrow&rsquo;, &lsquo;kindness&rsquo;, &lsquo;danger&rsquo; points out to the rooted influence that Sanskrit  could exercise in the initial stages of development of the language.&nbsp;&nbsp; The examples of Sanskrit replacing common  nouns in Malayalam are plenty.&nbsp; The  corresponding&nbsp; Malayalam words for &lsquo;sun&rsquo;,  &lsquo;moon&rsquo;, &lsquo;ornament&rsquo;, &lsquo;wife&rsquo; are not used widely now.&nbsp;&nbsp; In this context we can also observe that the  Malayalam words for &lsquo;father&rsquo; and &lsquo;mother&rsquo; are used mostly in ridicule.&nbsp; Dr. Godavarma expresses surprise in a particular  situation that several Prakriti words that are not seen in Tamil are seen in  Malayalam and in a language that had depended on all matters on Tamil before it  developed its own literature, these Prakriti words were unlikely to come  through Tamil.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He also points out some words as examples.  These prakriti words, seen in Malayalam but not in Tamil must be a pointer to  the mother tongue which came with the Namboodiris which they discarded  later.&nbsp;</font></em></font></p>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is one of the fundamental concepts of  language that it is impossible to have a language with hybrid forms of  grammar.&nbsp; Though the concept exists  without much of a difference in the Malayalam for common parlance, its literary  form deserves special attention of the language experts.&nbsp; It has not been properly enquired as to the  reason why the first book of grammar on Malayalam was written in the 15th  century based on the Manipravala (hybrid language of Sanskrit and Malayalam)  poetry and written in Sanskrit. &ldquo;Most of the time entire verses are in  Sanskrit; it may end with some Malayalam words.&nbsp;  It is seen that this unbridled use of Sanskrit words in the higher  literature has lead some Italian scholars to strange misconceptions&rdquo;.&nbsp; This description on the method of composition  of Manipravala works is of Ellis (1816).&nbsp;  Thus if it is understood that this body of &nbsp;poetry form filled with Sanskrit words and  retaining the grammatical forms of Sanskrit was not a strange section of the  language, but the first manifested form of the language, it can be seen  straight why the first grammar book on Malayalam was &lsquo;Leelathilakam&rsquo; and that it  was in Sanskrit. </font></em></font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font color="#000000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><em><font color="#CCCCCC"><br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During the middle ages in Kerala when  Namboodiris and Nayars reigned as the leaders, Manipravala literature formed as  a bye product of that co existence reveals more about its society than its  language.&nbsp; The fact that Malayalam developed  into literary creations through this hybrid language of Sanskrit and Malayalam  and that the subject of these were women was in a logical reasoning and  sequence.&nbsp; We have already seen the  initial stages of the method of development of the caste system and Malayalam  language.&nbsp; It was the survival need of  the Namboodiris to develop the dialect of the tribal folk now amalgamated into  the caste system to one that would suit the requirement of an established  society.&nbsp; And they did it only up to that  level.&nbsp; But they also restrained further  growth of the language to the extent of forbidding speaking with clarity the  Sanskrit words infused into Malayalam.&nbsp;  Thus the possibility of 99 percent of the people speaking Malayalam  improving the language ceased.&nbsp; Namboodiris  gave a literary form to the only relation they developed with the local tribes  and it resulted in the Manipravala literature composed in the hybrid language  of &nbsp;&lsquo;3 quarters Sanskrit and one quarter  malayalam&rsquo;.&nbsp; It can be seen that  Namboodiris were capable of little else and that society&rsquo;s capability was  limited to what Namboodiri could do. </font></em></font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font color="#000000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><em><font color="#CCCCCC"><br>
        The family system  of the Namboodiris and their conjugal relation with Nayars altered their mental  framework.&nbsp; Having come to a situation  were marriage was not possible for 90 percent of the Namboodiris, love between  a man and woman and relations suited for a society became alien concepts to  them.&nbsp; In the absence of marriage, love  for a wife and children were unknown to them.&nbsp;  Since they could not freely enter and move around at home, the family  love also was a rarity.&nbsp; The only  relation they could have with women were the relations they could have with the  Nayar women at night.&nbsp; It was natural  that in the absence of any legality or indebtedness to these untouchable women  who were subservient, this degraded into mere sexual intercourse. The natural  springs of love in life having dried up, Namboodiris became a lot who could not  distinguish the social appropriateness in their natural senses or  interactions.&nbsp; </font></em></font></p>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Knowledgeable in Sanskrit they were also  by and large knowledgeable in epics, poetry and drama.&nbsp; Unable to move around at will at home, their  only occupation during the day was to gather somewhere and gossip.&nbsp; They spent the day eagerly looking forward to  their companion at night and gossiping.&nbsp;  Enemies to script, these Brahmins were exemplary in learning and keeping  things in memory.&nbsp; It must have been as  part of this gossiping that they created this imaginative couplets and poetic  compositions on their fair companions.&nbsp;  It can be assumed that like today&rsquo;s poetry competitions they competed to  create couplets paying attention to language and the mood of love in their  familiar three quarter Sanskrit and one quarter Malayalam mix.&nbsp; It can be assumed that the more imaginative  among them composed longer poetry and these instant poetic compositions were a  part of their gossiping group to pass their day time.&nbsp; Being masters in the art of memorising, we  can think that these were known by heart to many.&nbsp; No other social circumstance can be seen that  would prompt the Namboodiris to compose poetry in Malayalam and on the  society.&nbsp; </font></em></font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font color="#000000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><em><font color="#CCCCCC"><br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It has been pointed out by many readers  of &lsquo;Leelathilakam&rsquo; that the couplets cited as examples in it must have been  from the memorised version of the manipravala poetry. It has to be assumed that  like this conjugal games at night, the competitive poetic fireworks conducted  as groups during daytime was a routine and that thousands of the compositions  were lost.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However we have to note one  thing with gratitude.&nbsp; Manipravala poetry  was the first literary form that evolved in Kerala.&nbsp; The encouragement for Malayalam language to  move to a literary language was also provided by the manipravala  literature.&nbsp; The reason why breasts of  women and related words frequent Malayalam poetry before the 20th  century like shells on the sea shore is because of this. For those who discover  and place songs as the origin of &nbsp;Malayalam poetry, the songs quoted by them and  their language, however hard you push will not date to the 15th  century when viewed historically.&nbsp; It has  to be concluded that Malayalam language entered the realms of literature  through the Manipravala poetry.&nbsp; The  cultural excellences of any society are the creation of its upper classes.&nbsp; Seen that way Manipravala literature is the  truthful expression of the Kerala caste society of that time. The development  of the society, the evolution of the language and the forces that moulded them are  exemplified by Manipravala literature.</font></em></font></p>
