          <em><font face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Language was a gift he had and he had  made prolific use of it through out his college days and later mostly for  political purposes. Though not formally, he had proved his mettle and the first  job offer as chief editor proved that the caliber of the man was recognized. He  started his formal career in journalism as Chief Editor of the daily news paper  Dinaprabha ,on 27th July 1958 at the age of 32 years which was published, from  Kozhicode. He quit after a year due to differences with the management. </font></em></p>

        He was invited to join in another Malayalam daily Kerala Kaumudi as scribe  during 1960. His entry and exit 17 years later was equally dramatic.  Subservience was not one of his qualities and this naturally lead to friction  with the owners. The long tenure with this news paper could be the result of  stabilizing influence of marriage and the consequent responsibilities. He was  suspended and then dismissed from service 17 years later. Probably he is the  only employee who had the honour of having the newspaper write an editorial on  why they had to dismiss him. It can be said without doubt that his caliber as a  journalist was not utilized inspite of his long tenure with the newspaper. But  his job schedule of working late into midnight on alternate days also gave him  spare time for his reading and literary activities. The years that followed the  dismissal saw him fighting a prolonged legal battle with Kerala Kaumudi that ended  in his favour. He later joined as the chief editor of Kerala  Bhooshanam(published from Kottayam) for a brief period. His tenure in the daily  saw its circulation increase in geometric proportions. His career as a  journalist ended as chief editor of Madhyamam Daily, published from Kozhicode,  which ironically was the place where he started his career as a journalist. </font></em></p>
