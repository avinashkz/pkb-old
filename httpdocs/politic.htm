        Political Encounters in His Life</b></font> </p>
      <p align="justify"><font color="#333333" size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">His 
        voracious reading habit had already created a high degree of political 
        awareness in Balakrishnan. Reading through the numerous volumes of history 
        of the Indian National Congress and a close watch of the political activities 
        around him had invigorated him to join the main stream political movement 
        of the time. Participation in the quit India movement landed him in jail. 
        It was in prison that he first met people like C.Achutha Menon and K.Karunakaran 
        (both were to become Chief Ministers later) who were serving their jail 
        term as political prisoners. <br>
        He then spent a few years as full time member of Prajamandalam, the Congress 
        unit of Cochin State which later split and formed the Kerala Socialist 
        Party under Mathai Manjoornan. He had strong convictions and he stood 
        by his beliefs. He soon found that these were not sound 'political' qualities 
        and finding politics unfit for him and himself unfit for politics, literally 
        ran away from it at the middle of the night with his meager belongings 
        tucked under his arm. The net result of all this was a ruined academic 
        future. He put to full use his capabilities as an orator and writer during 
        this period of political activity. He was the force behind the weekly 
        'Azad', the mouthpiece of the student Congress started in1947. Later he 
        edited the weekly of the Kerala Socialist party - 'Socialist'. He wrote 
        innumerable political articles during this period in these and many other 
        publications. He had established his reputation as a writer by this time.<br>
