        Politics always interested Balakrishnan. His real contact with politics 
        started in college. The freedom struggle had hottened up and took up his 
        interest and time in the place of studies. Participation in the Quit India 
        movement landed him in jail. The British treated political prisoners with 
        respect. He met people like C.Achutha Menon and K.Karunakaran (both were 
        to become Chief Ministers later) during his prison term. Though his formal 
        studies ended after 4 years in college, his interest and political activities 
        continued.<br>
        He then spent a few years as full time member of Prajamandalam, the Congress 
        unit of Cochin State which later split and formed the Kerala Socialist 
        Party under Mathai Manjoornan. He had strong convictions and he stood 
        by his beliefs. He soon found that these were not sound 'political' qualities 
        and finding politics unfit for him and himself unfit for politics, literally 
        ran away from it at the middle of the night with his meager belongings 
        tucked under his arm The net result of all this was a ruined academic 
        future. <br>
        He put to full use his capabilities as an orator and writer during this 
        period of political activity. He was the main person behind the weekly 
        'Azad' started in1947, which was the mouthpiece of the student Congress. 
        Later he edited the weekly of the Kerala Socialist party - 'Socialist'. 
        He wrote innumerable political articles during this period in these and 
        many other publications. He had established his reputation as a writer 
        by this time.<br>
