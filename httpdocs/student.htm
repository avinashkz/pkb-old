      <h1>Balakrishnan The Student</h1>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Learning  started with first letters on sand spread out at Madhavan Asan&rsquo;s Kalari (Kalari  is where learning started in olden days under the guidance of an &lsquo;Asan&rsquo;=  teacher). However the little student soon dropped out scared of the drunken  teacher. His learning continued through the Sanmarga Pradeepika Sabha (SPS  Primary)School, Lower Secondary School, and finally The Rama Varma Union High  school (1940) in the neighbouring village of Cherai. His oratorical skills  developed during this period. He was actively encouraged by his teachers. The  headmaster K.C.Abraham or Abraham master (who later served as governor of  Andhra Pradesh) and Alexander, the Malayalam teacher were tutors here with whom  he maintained contacts and whom he remembered with great respect. He also read  extensively on a level that far exceeded his age. He passed out of school with  a gold medal and a scholarship for higher studies</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
        He shifted to Ernakulam and joined the Maharajas College for his higher  studies. He selected science as his subject as he was told that it was the most  difficult to study. He was very active in college. However, academic studies  were last in his agenda. It was the time when the freedom movement had gathered  momentum and there was no way the energetic youth could keep himself out of it.  He whole-heartedly jumped into it. The involvement in quit India movement ended  in jail. He used to say in private that the stay in jail as a class B detainee  together with the sons of influential persons would have been enjoyable if only  he could make his weekend trips home (it was his unfailing habit).Thus, his  four eventful years in college ended without any qualification degree.</font></p>
