  journey as an author starts from &#8216;Narayana &#8216;Guru&#8217;. 
  A comprehensive work on the great reformer and spiritual leader of Kerala, 
  the book not only depicts a great man in his true dimensions, it also 
  amply points to the great mind and understanding of Balakrishanan who 
  would have been hardly 23 years at the time. Most of Balakrishnan&#8217;s 
  works are critical works. His studies on Chandu Menon (the first widely 
  accepted Malayali novelist), the art of poetry studied through Kumaran 
  Asan (the doyen of Malayalam literature) Vyasa Bharath &amp; Ezhuthachan 
  (the father of Malayalam poetry) and the art of the novel are unparelled 
  works that enriched critical literature.</font></font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font color="#333333" size="2" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">An avid reader, history fascinated him. Kerala history interested him 
  tremendously. He found that there was a disconnect between what the 
  existing writings on history sought to project, and what he saw of Kerala 
  from the old literature, travelogues, and other first hand sources that 
  is used to study history.</font><font color="#333333" size="2" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">In his writings he first dealt with Kerala 
  history in the anthology &#8216;Narayana Guru&#8217; on the great social 
  reformer of Kerala who changed the face of its caste ridden society.</font><font color="#333333" size="2" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">To fully comprehend the greatness of the man and the work he did, the 
  history of Kerala in the 18th and 19th centuries are studied as a back 
  drop. He brushes with Kerala history again to study why Tipu Sultan, 
  an able ruler and administrator is only perceived as an aggressor and 
  religious fanatic in our writings. The culmination of these studies 
  over 3 decades was his work on social history &#8216;Jaathivyavasthayum 
  Kerala Charitravum&#8217; (The Caste System and History of Kerala). 
  The book created a furore in the &#8216;historical circles&#8217; and 
  generated widespread interest and discussion on Kerala history. The 
  unrealistic and imaginative flourishes that were passed off as history 
  were debunked with this single work. The people and their history were 
  studied within the reality frame work of the caste system, agriculture, 
  commerce, administrative set up etc. It is a seminal work that deals 
  with various aspects of Kerala&#8217;s history including the development 
  of the Malayalam language.</font></p></td>

    <td width="12%" height="513" valign="top"> <p align="justify"><font color="#333333" size="2" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">However what catapulted him as a popular writer was his second novel 
      &#8216;Ini Njan Urangatte&#8217; (And Now Let Me Sleep), a novel that 
      subsists on the Mahabharath. The book is unparalleled in its lofty language, 
      imagery and depth and is considered one of the best classics in Indian 
      Literature. The novel is the story of Karna as seen through the eyes 
      of Draupadi. A work originating from the Vyasabharatha (Mahabharath), 
      it has caught the stylised language and mood of the great epic. It gives 
      a new intellectual and spiritual dimension to the recreated Draupadi 
      (the wife of the Pandavas). Her painful story unveils around the unacknowledged 
      eldest Pandava, Karna, born to maiden Kunti from the sun god. The novel 
      maintains the original story, epic atmosphere, events and characters 
      which distinguishes it from other works based on Mahabharatha. It won 
      him the Kerala Sahitya Akademi award, Sahitya Pravarthaka Benefit Fund 
      award and the prestigious Vayalar award given in honour of the poet 
      Vayalar Rama Varma,who was immortalised in Malayalam cinema by his beautiful 
      lyrics. </font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font color="#333333" size="2" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">&#8216;Ini Njan Urangatte&#8217; was quite a departure from his first 
        novel &#8216;Pluto&#8217; the story of his dog set in the back drop 
        of his native village of Edavanakkad peopled by his friends and relatives. <br />
        While his extensive interests resulted in full fledged books, his numerous 
        other interests resulted in various articles. No serious attempts were 
        made to preserve the articles he wrote. So, many of these were lost 
        after their first publication. Some of these were complied and published 
        in his life time &#8216;Mayatha Sandhyakal&#8217; (Unfading Twilights) 
        and &#8216;Nidra Sancharangal&#8217; (Sleep Walkings). These were combined 
        and brought out as Balakrishnante Lekhanangal (Articles of Balakrishnan) 
        in 2005. A subsequent collection of articles were published as &#8216;Keraleeyathayum 
        Mattum&#8217; (The Essence of Kerala etc).</font></p>
