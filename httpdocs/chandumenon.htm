<p align="justify"><font size="4" color="#CCCCCC">&quot;It was not the greatness 
  of the literary figure of Chandumenon that first attracted me to him. His personality 
  is much bigger than his writings. My contact with his literature is as a tool 
  that reveals his special personality. His personality has many useful facets 
  if understood in the context of the prevailing social milieu. My main attempt 
  in this book is to present that vast personality which I perceived. It means 
  that this book is not strictly a literary criticism. Exclusive essays on literature 
  itself <br>
  are handled through this view point.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="4"> <font color="#CCCCCC">The preface to this book is written by 
  the author's friend Prof. M. K. Sanoo.</font></font></p>
<p><font size="4" color="#CCCCCC"> The book is dedicated to his teacher Sri.K.J. 
  Alexander.</font></p>
