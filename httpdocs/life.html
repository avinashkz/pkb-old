<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A powerhouse to be 
  reckoned with in the intellectual space of Kerala, Balakrishnan was an author 
  par excellence, a committed and daring journalist, a fiery orator and above 
  all a great human being.He authored one of best and most widely read novels 
  of the language,a controversial and original history of the state,and a series 
  of studies unparalleled in their depth and understanding of the subject and 
  originality of vision.He never took the beaten tracks in whatever he did. His 
  vision and learning took him through unchartered territories which he conquered 
  with his characteristic mastery. </font></p>

<p align="justify"><strong><font color="#333333" size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><font size="+1" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">His 
  journey as an author</font></font></strong><font size="+1"> :</font> <font face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">His 
  journey as an author starts from &lsquo;Narayana &lsquo;Guru&rsquo;. A comprehensive 
  work on the great reformer and spiritual leader of Kerala, the book not only 
  depicts a great man in his true dimensions, it also amply points to the great 
  mind and understanding of Balakrishanan who would have been hardly 23 years 
  at the time. Most of Balakrishnan&rsquo;s works are critical works. His studies 
  on Chandu Menon (the first widely accepted Malayali novelist), the art of poetry 
  studied through Kumaran Asan (the doyen of Malayalam literature) Vyasa Bharath 
  &amp; Ezhuthachan (the father of Malayalam poetry) and the art of the novel 
  are unparelled works that enriched critical literature.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">An avid reader, history fascinated him. Kerala history  interested him tremendously. He found that there was a disconnect between what  the existing writings on history sought to project, and what he saw of Kerala  from the old literature, travelogues, and other first hand sources that is used  to study history.In his writings he first dealt with Kerala history in the  anthology &lsquo;Narayana Guru&rsquo; on the great social reformer of Kerala who changed  the face of its caste ridden society.To fully comprehend the greatness of the  man and the work he did, the history of Kerala in the 18th and 19th centuries  are studied as a back drop. He brushes with Kerala history again to study why  Tipu Sultan, an able ruler and administrator is only perceived as an aggressor  and religious fanatic in our writings. The culmination of these studies over 3  decades was his work on social history &lsquo;Jaathivyavasthayum Kerala Charitravum&rsquo;  (The Caste System and History of Kerala). The book created a furore in the  &lsquo;historical circles&rsquo; and generated widespread interest and discussion on Kerala  history. The unrealistic and imaginative flourishes that were passed off as  history were debunked with this single work. The people and their history were  studied within the reality frame work of the caste system, agriculture,  commerce, administrative set up etc. It is a seminal work that deals with  various aspects of Kerala&rsquo;s history including the development of the Malayalam  language.<br>
  However what catapulted him as a popular writer was his  second novel &lsquo;Ini Njan Urangatte&rsquo; (And Now Let Me Sleep), a novel that subsists  on the Mahabharath. The book is unparalleled in its lofty language, imagery and  depth and is considered one of the best classics in Indian Literature. The  novel is the story of Karna as seen through the eyes of Draupadi. A work  originating from the Vyasabharatha (Mahabharath), it has caught the stylised  language and mood of the great epic. It gives a new intellectual and spiritual  dimension to the recreated Draupadi (the wife of the Pandavas). Her painful  story unveils around the unacknowledged eldest Pandava, Karna, born to maiden  Kunti from the sun god. The novel maintains the original story, epic  atmosphere, events and characters which distinguishes it from other works based  on Mahabharatha. It won him the Kerala Sahitya Akademi award, Sahitya  Pravarthaka Benefit Fund award and the prestigious Vayalar award given in  honour of the poet Vayalar Rama Varma,who was immortalised in Malayalam cinema  by his beautiful lyrics. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&lsquo;Ini Njan Urangatte&rsquo; was quite a departure from his first  novel &lsquo;Pluto&rsquo; the story of his dog set in the back drop of his native village   of Edavanakkad peopled by his  friends and relatives. <br>
  While his extensive interests resulted in full fledged  books, his numerous other interests resulted in various articles. No serious  attempts were made to preserve the articles he wrote. So, many of these were  lost after their first publication. Some of these were complied and published  in his life time &lsquo;Mayatha Sandhyakal&rsquo; (Unfading Twilights) and &lsquo;Nidra  Sancharangal&rsquo; (Sleep Walkings). These were combined and brought out as  Balakrishnante Lekhanangal (Articles of Balakrishnan) in 2005. A subsequent  collection of articles were published as &lsquo;Keraleeyathayum Mattum&rsquo; (The Essence  of Kerala etc).</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As on date Balakrishnan has 11 published books to his  credit.</font></p>
